Here is my final project for ITP 115!
It is a tetris program built in Python using a graphics module I found online from https://mcsp.wartburg.edu//zelle/python/graphics.py which is a wrapper for the Tkinter module
To move a piece, use the left, right, and down arrow keys. Rotate it using the up arrow key.
Also, a piece can be held with the 'c' key. There is no limit to the number of times you can hold a piece during a move to make up with some somewhat clunky rotations when a piece is against another surface.
Also, a 'cheat mode' can be toggled on and off by typing 's', which makes all future pieces the OP stick piece. 
Over time, the pieces drop faster.
Scores are based on the number of lines cleared, and the top 10 high scores are stored to a file and displayed at the end of every game. If the player places in the top 10, they can enter their name into the leaderboard.
On Windows, there is also sound... and a fun easter egg (so play it a few times) ;)
Enjoy!
